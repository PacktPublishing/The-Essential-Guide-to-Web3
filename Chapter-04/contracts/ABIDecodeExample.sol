/**
In this program, we have a simple Person struct that contains a name, age, and wallet 
address. We then have two functions: encodePerson and decodePerson.

The encodePerson function takes a Person struct as input and uses the abi.encode 
function to convert it into a bytes array. The abi.encode function takes in multiple 
arguments of different types and converts them into a tightly packed bytes array.

The decodePerson function takes a bytes array as input and uses the abi.decode 
function to convert it into a Person struct. The abi.decode function takes two 
arguments - the bytes array to decode, and a tuple of the expected types that the
bytes array contains. In this case, we expect the bytes array to contain a string, 
uint, and address in that order, so we pass (string, uint, address) as the second argument.

Using ABI encoding and decoding, we can easily pass complex data structures 
between contracts and external applications.
