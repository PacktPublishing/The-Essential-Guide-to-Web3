/**
The Math library contains several mathematical functions, such as add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide, which take two unsigned integer parameters and return an unsigned integer result. 
These functions are marked as internal, which means they can only be accessed within the 
contract that defines the library.

Each function performs some mathematical operation, and some of them include additional 
checks to prevent integer overflow or division by zero. If a check fails, a require statement
is used to revert the transaction with an error message.

The Calculator contract uses the using keyword to import the Math library and make its
functions available for use within the contract. The result variable is used to store 
the result of the latest operation.

The add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions in the Calculator contract simply 
call the corresponding function in the Math library and store the result in the result 
variable.

In summary, a library in Solidity is a separate contract that can contain reusable
functions that can be shared across multiple contracts. The using keyword is used to 
import a library into a contract, allowing its functions to be called as if they were 
part of the contract itself. This can help reduce code duplication and improve code 
readability and maintainability.
